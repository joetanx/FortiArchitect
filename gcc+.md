## 1. Next Generation Firewall

### 1.1. Intrusion Prevention System

Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) detects network attacks and prevents threats from compromising the network, including protected devices.

IPS can be in the form of a standalone appliance, or part of the feature set of a Next Generation Firewall (NGFW), such as FortiGate.

IPS utilizes signatures, protocol decoders, heuristics (or behavioral monitoring), threat intelligence (such as FortiGuard Labs), and advanced threat detection in order to prevent exploitation of known and unknown zero-day threats.

FortiGate IPS is even capable of performing deep packet inspection to scan encrypted payloads in order to detect and prevent threats from attackers.

- Up to date IPS with latest data on IPS signatures, malicious URLs and Botnet IPs and Domains from FortiGuard
  - The FortiGuard Service periodically adds new predefined signatures to counter new threats. New predefined signatures are automatically included in IPS sensors that are configured to use filters when the new signatures match existing filter specifications.
  - FortiGuard Service continually updates the botnet C&C domain list. The botnet C&C domain blocking feature can block the botnet website access at the DNS name resolving stage.
- Prevent Botnet C&C communication via various methods: IPS signatures, malicious URLs and Botnet IPs and Domains

### 1.2. Secure Web Gateway

#### 1.2.1. DNS Filtering

DNS filtering takes place at the domain name resolution level, which means that undesired traffic can be prevented even before any inspection needs to occur.

Integration with FortiGuard enables FortiGuard category-based DNS domain filter and Botnet C&C domain blocking. This makes use of FortiGuard's continuously updated domain rating database and botnet C&C domain list for more reliable protection.

#### 1.2.2. Antivirus

FortiGate can be configured to apply antivirus protection to HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3, SMTP, CIFS, and NNTP sessions. Proxy-based profiles also support MAPI and SSH.

Antivirus inspection prevents potentially unwanted and malicious files from entering the network.

Antivirus profiles include multiple different functions, such as scanning files for virus signatures, scanning for advanced persistent threats, checking external malware hash lists and threat feeds, and others. Malicious files can be blocked or monitored, and can be quarantined.

#### 1.2.3. Web Filtering

The FortiGuard filter enhances the web filter features by sorting billions of web pages into a wide range of categories that users can allow or block.

The FortiGuard Web Filtering service includes over 45 million individual website ratings that apply to more than two billion pages.

When the FortiGuard filter is enabled in a web filter profile and applied to firewall policies, if a request for a web page appears in traffic controlled by one of the firewall policies, the URL is sent to the nearest FortiGuard server. The URL category or rating is returned.
- If the category is blocked, the FortiGate shows a replacement message in place of the requested page.
- If the category is not blocked, the page request is sent to the requested URL as normal.

- content inspection with SSL inspection (web filtering, application control, antivirus)
- user authentication

#### 1.2.4. User Authentication

FortiGate enhances Secure Web Gateway (SWG) capabilities by integrating user authentication, ensuring that traffic is allowed only for authenticated users who comply with firewall policies.

- If a user is authenticated and authorized according to the firewall policy, FortiGate permits the web traffic to proceed.
- If a user fails to authenticate or doesn't meet the policy requirements, FortiGate blocks the traffic, preventing unauthorized access to web resources.

This approach adds an additional layer of security to the Secure Web Gateway, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and enforcing compliance with security policies.

By integrating user authentication with SWG functionality, FortiGate ensures that only authorized users can access web resources, enhancing overall network security and control.

### 1.3. Comparison with Cloud-Native or Open Source solutions

#### 1.3.1. AWS Firewall

AWS firewall provides some basic web filtering and intrusion prevention capabilities, but it is insufficient in detecting and mitigating advanced threats.

1. **Rudimentary Web Filtering and Intrusion Prevention**:
   While AWS firewall offers some level of web filtering and intrusion prevention, its capabilities are basic and may not be sufficient to defend against sophisticated threats. The firewall primarily relies on SNI-based (Server Name Indication) and signature-based blocking techniques. While these methods can be effective against known threats, they may struggle to detect and prevent advanced or zero-day attacks that don't match predefined signatures.

2. **Limited Intrusion Detection Capabilities**:
   Although AWS firewall provides some intrusion detection capabilities, they are limited in scope. The intrusion detection feature may offer basic alerts for suspicious network activity, but it may lack advanced detection mechanisms for identifying complex attack patterns or anomalies. This limitation could result in missed detections of emerging threats or sophisticated attack techniques.

3. **Reliance on Open Source Suricata for Extended Intrusion Detection**:
   To supplement the rudimentary intrusion detection capabilities of AWS firewall, users may choose to integrate open-source solutions like Suricata. Suricata is a widely used Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) that offers more advanced features for detecting and mitigating network-based attacks. However, deploying and managing Suricata alongside AWS firewall adds complexity to the setup and may require additional expertise and resources.

> **Web filtering**
>
> AWS Network Firewall supports inbound and outbound web filtering for unencrypted web traffic. For encrypted web traffic, Server Name Indication (SNI) is used for blocking access to specific sites. SNI is an extension to Transport Layer Security (TLS) that remains unencrypted in the traffic flow and indicates the destination hostname a client is attempting to access over HTTPS. In addition, AWS Network Firewall can filter fully qualified domain names (FQDN).

> **Intrusion prevention**
>
> AWS Network Firewallâ€™s intrusion prevention system (IPS) provides active traffic flow inspection with real-time network and application layer protections against vulnerability exploits and brute force attacks. Its signature-based detection engine matches network traffic patterns to known threat signatures based on attributes such as byte sequences or packet anomalies.

#### 1.3.2. Squid / Nginx

Squid and Nginx provide basic forward proxy capabilities, but they lack security features in content inspection and depends on manual updates for web filtering blacklists.

1. **Limited Content Inspection**: While Squid and Nginx offer basic forward proxy capabilities, they lack robust content inspection features. Without content inspection, these proxies cannot thoroughly analyze the content of web traffic passing through them. This limitation makes it challenging to detect and block malicious content, such as malware, phishing attempts, or inappropriate content.

2. **Dependency on External Sources for Filtering**: To enhance web filtering capabilities, administrators often integrate SquidGuard with Squid. However, SquidGuard relies on external blacklists, such as Shalla's Blacklists or URLhaus, for URL filtering. These blacklists need to be manually updated and may not provide real-time protection against emerging threats. As a result, there can be delays in blocking malicious URLs or botnet domains until the blacklists are updated.

3. **Lack of Automatic Updates for Blacklists**: One of the significant limitations is the absence of automatic updates for blacklists in SquidGuard. Administrators must regularly monitor and manually update the blacklists to ensure they contain the latest information about malicious URLs and botnet domains. This manual process can be time-consuming and may lead to gaps in protection if updates are overlooked or delayed.

4. **Reliance on Community-Supported Solutions**: Open-source Squid, Nginx, and SquidGuard rely heavily on community-supported solutions for updates, patches, and documentation. While community contributions can be valuable, they may not always meet the same level of reliability, support, and security as commercial solutions. As a result, organizations using open-source proxies may face challenges in maintaining the stability and security of their web filtering infrastructure.
