i have gathered the following use cases for EDR and SOAR solution from the security team:

1. To create a blocking rule in firewall based on the IP address
- To be able to ingest a csv file attachment from email server through a specific template (i.e. removal of [.] from csv file)
- To make changes in firewall to block all outbound connection (An approval workflow is required before modification of firewall rules.) 

2. To show case the capability of implementing an automated response plan with zero-day vulnerability such as Log4J or known vulnerabilities/domain such as Polyfill:
- To collection of indicators suspected of trying to exploit the relevant CVEs or through email server
- To perform active search detection based on the reported signature
- The ability to perform virtual patching to reduce attack surface related to the zero day vulnerability


3. To demonstrate playbook on investigation of suspicious activities (e.g. misused account/high login failures):
- To detect or correlate alerts from log (i.e. Azure Log Analytics workspace/ AWS Cloudtrail) to detect login failure events and/or identify potential misuse of action:
- To show which processes/applications are using these accounts or how this activities are triggered
- To inform the incident response team to investigate via email
- To allow the team to disable the account, if required.

4. To be able to automatically perform threat hunting to detect anomaly (e.g. an application connecting to a malicious IP based):
- To be able to receive Threat Intelligence (TI) such as virus total, alienvault or OTX
- To search for potential breach based from various log sources (i.e. Firewall, EDR, log storage) on the IOC provided by the TI
- To be able to allow the incident response team be able to identify what are the affected application attempting to make the connection
- To create a case for incident response team to close
- To inform incident response team of any potential breach

5. To create a blocking rule in firewall based on the IP address
- To detect or correlate alerts from EDR and Firewall logs to detect anomaly behaviour on the followings
  - Execution of unusual process on the server;
  - Unauthorised changes of a registry key of the server; 
  - Connection of Network Abnormality Connection (e.g. potential C2 connectivity); 
  - Detection of suspicious Activities based on behavioural/heuristic based;
  - Detect other types of unusual activities;

6. To inform the incident response team of an incident via email alerts
- Case management in managing the incident with multiple stakeholders (e.g. incident response team, business users and management).

7. To show demonstrate
- How the different teams can use the playbook to perform incident management and reporting where possible.

8. To be able to perform these containment actions:
- To automatically trigger the EDR to contain and isolate vulnerable endpoints from the network
- To execute two types of AV scan on affected endpoints Investigate
- To disable/delete the affected accounts

9. To allow user to perform investigation:
- To investigate the extend of the malware spread (could be show case affected to another windows/linux server) and able to isolate quickly
- To be able to collect this information on the affected server:
  - Account (local or domain)
  - Memory dumps
  - Suspicious files (zipped and password protected)
  - Hashes
  - Registry hives
  - Logs pertaining to the incident

10. To allow user to perform recovery action:
- Enable back the impacted user accounts
- Recover the vulnerable machine based on the good working copy for virtual server, If necessary, to rebuild or re-provision the impacted system
- Reconnect back the affected the machine to the network after the system is cleared for connection

the points are quite scattered and have overlaps, can you organize the information to provide a smooth storyboard?
</details>

Certainly! I can help you structure these use cases into a coherent storyboard that follows a logical flow for understanding how EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) solutions are applied in a security incident lifecycle. Here's a streamlined approach to organizing these use cases:

---

### **Storyboard for EDR and SOAR Solutions**

#### **1. Incident Detection and Initial Response**

**Use Case 1: Firewall Blocking Rule Creation**
- **Action**: Create a firewall rule to block a specific IP address.
- **Details**:
  - Ingest CSV file attachments from email servers with specific templates.
  - Example: Remove [.] from CSV file for proper parsing.
  - Approval workflow required before modifying firewall rules to block outbound connections.

**Use Case 2: Automated Response to Vulnerabilities**
- **Action**: Implement automated response plans for zero-day vulnerabilities (e.g., Log4J) or known vulnerabilities.
- **Details**:
  - Collect indicators from suspected exploits via email or other sources.
  - Perform active search detection based on reported signatures.
  - Apply virtual patching to mitigate the zero-day vulnerability.

---

#### **2. Investigation of Suspicious Activities**

**Use Case 3: Investigation Playbook for Suspicious Activities**
- **Action**: Automate the investigation of suspicious activities such as misuse of accounts or high login failures.
- **Details**:
  - Correlate alerts from logs (e.g., Azure Log Analytics, AWS CloudTrail) for login failures and potential misuse.
  - Identify processes or applications involved in these activities.
  - Notify the incident response team via email.
  - Allow the team to disable the account if needed.

**Use Case 4: Threat Hunting and Detection**
- **Action**: Automate threat hunting to detect anomalies (e.g., application connecting to a malicious IP).
- **Details**:
  - Receive Threat Intelligence (TI) from sources like VirusTotal, AlienVault, or OTX.
  - Search for breaches based on IOCs from TI across various log sources (Firewall, EDR, etc.).
  - Identify affected applications and create a case for the incident response team.
  - Inform the incident response team of any potential breaches.

---

#### **3. Containment and Mitigation**

**Use Case 8: Automated Containment Actions**
- **Action**: Perform containment actions automatically.
- **Details**:
  - Trigger EDR to isolate vulnerable endpoints from the network.
  - Execute AV scans on affected endpoints.
  - Disable or delete compromised accounts.

---

#### **4. Recovery and Reporting**

**Use Case 9: Investigation and Recovery Actions**
- **Action**: Conduct thorough investigation and recovery actions.
- **Details**:
  - Investigate malware spread and isolate affected systems (Windows/Linux).
  - Collect information: account details, memory dumps, suspicious files (zipped/password protected), hashes, registry hives, and logs.
  - Enable affected user accounts.
  - Recover or rebuild the impacted machine from a clean copy.
  - Reconnect the machine to the network once cleared.

**Use Case 10: Case Management and Reporting**
- **Action**: Manage incidents and report findings.
- **Details**:
  - Inform incident response team via email alerts.
  - Manage cases with multiple stakeholders (incident response team, business users, management).
  - Demonstrate how different teams use playbooks for incident management and reporting.

---

### **Storyboard Summary**

1. **Incident Detection**: Begin by detecting threats and creating initial responses, such as blocking malicious IPs and applying automated responses to vulnerabilities.
2. **Investigation**: Use automated playbooks to investigate suspicious activities and perform threat hunting based on intelligence sources.
3. **Containment**: Automate containment actions to isolate threats and mitigate their impact.
4. **Recovery and Reporting**: Conduct detailed investigations and recovery actions, followed by managing cases and reporting to stakeholders.

By following this structured approach, you can ensure a smooth and comprehensive response to security incidents, leveraging EDR and SOAR solutions effectively.
