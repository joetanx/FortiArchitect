# 1. Integration between firewall, EDR, SIEM and SOAR

Integration of Firewall, EDR, SIEM, and SOAR creates a robust security ecosystem, enhancing threat detection, response, and overall operational efficiency.

## 1.1. Integration Overview

- **Purpose of Integration:**
  - To create a cohesive security ecosystem where data and alerts are shared seamlessly.
  - To enhance detection, response, and compliance by leveraging the strengths of each tool.

## 1.2. Example Integration Scenario

**Scenario:** A company’s network has been compromised by an advanced persistent threat (APT). Here's how each tool contributes to detecting and mitigating the threat:

### A. Firewall and SIEM Integration

- **How It Works:**
  - **Firewall Logs:** Firewalls generate logs of network traffic, including allowed and denied connections, potential threats, and policy violations.
  - **SIEM Aggregation:** These logs are collected by the SIEM system, which aggregates and correlates data from various sources.
  
- **Example:**
  - **Firewall Alert:** The firewall detects unusual traffic patterns indicative of a potential data exfiltration attempt.
  - **SIEM Correlation:** The SIEM correlates this firewall alert with other logs (e.g., user login activities) and identifies a pattern consistent with a known APT signature.

- **Benefit:**
  - **Enhanced Visibility:** SIEM’s ability to correlate logs from the firewall with other data sources helps in identifying sophisticated threats that might not be apparent from a single log source.

### B. EDR and SIEM Integration

- **How It Works:**
  - **EDR Detection:** EDR solutions monitor endpoints for suspicious behaviors such as unusual file modifications, process executions, or network connections.
  - **SIEM Correlation:** EDR alerts are sent to the SIEM, which correlates these with other security data to provide context.

- **Example:**
  - **EDR Alert:** An endpoint detects and flags a malicious executable trying to connect to an external IP address.
  - **SIEM Analysis:** The SIEM correlates this endpoint alert with firewall logs indicating communication with a known bad IP address and previous suspicious login attempts.

- **Benefit:**
  - **Contextualized Threat Detection:** SIEM enriches EDR data with additional context, improving threat analysis and prioritization.

### C. SOAR and SIEM Integration

- **How It Works:**
  - **SIEM Alerts:** SIEM generates alerts based on correlated data and detected anomalies.
  - **SOAR Automation:** SOAR platforms can ingest these alerts and automate responses based on predefined workflows and playbooks.

- **Example:**
  - **SIEM Alert:** The SIEM detects a pattern of suspicious activity consistent with a ransomware attack.
  - **SOAR Response:** The SOAR system automatically triggers a response, such as isolating affected systems, blocking malicious IP addresses, and notifying the security team.

- **Benefit:**
  - **Automated Response:** SOAR automates repetitive tasks, reducing response times and minimizing the impact of incidents.

### D. Firewall and SOAR Integration

- **How It Works:**
  - **Firewall Policy Enforcement:** SOAR platforms can interact with firewalls to dynamically adjust policies based on ongoing threats.
  - **Automated Policy Adjustments:** For example, SOAR can create firewall rules to block malicious IPs detected during an incident.

- **Example:**
  - **SOAR Alert:** During an incident, SOAR identifies a malicious IP address through threat intelligence.
  - **Firewall Action:** SOAR sends a command to the firewall to block traffic from this IP address.

- **Benefit:**
  - **Dynamic Defense:** SOAR enables real-time adjustments to firewall rules based on emerging threats, enhancing protection.

### E. EDR and SOAR Integration

- **How It Works:**
  - **Endpoint Data:** EDR tools provide detailed data on endpoint activities and threats.
  - **SOAR Automation:** SOAR can use this data to automate responses, such as isolating endpoints or performing forensic analysis.

- **Example:**
  - **EDR Detection:** EDR detects a malware infection on a workstation.
  - **SOAR Response:** SOAR initiates a predefined response, such as quarantining the infected endpoint and initiating a forensic investigation.

- **Benefit:**
  - **Streamlined Incident Handling:** SOAR automates complex incident response procedures based on detailed EDR insights.

## 1.3. Benefits of Integration

- **Comprehensive Threat Detection:** Combining data from Firewalls, EDR, and SIEM provides a more complete view of potential threats.
- **Efficient Incident Response:** SOAR automates and orchestrates responses, reducing manual effort and response time.
- **Improved Compliance and Governance:** Integrated solutions ensure that security policies are enforced and compliance requirements are met effectively.
- **Enhanced Operational Efficiency:** Streamlined processes and automated tasks reduce the burden on security teams and optimize resource use.

## 1.4. Best Practices for Integration

### **Diagram Description**

- **Master Tenant:**
  - **Master Firewall (M_F)**: Manages global firewall rules and policies.
  - **Master SIEM (M_SIEM)**: Aggregates and correlates data from all local SIEMs to provide central intelligence.
  - **Master SOAR (M_SOAR)**: Distributes updated playbooks and intelligence to local SOAR instances.

- **Local Tenant Instances:**
  - **Local Firewall (A_F, B_F, C_F)**: Collects logs and sends them to local SIEMs.
  - **Local SIEM (A_SIEM, B_SIEM, C_SIEM)**: Analyzes and correlates data locally, streams data to the master SIEM.
  - **Local SOAR (A_SOAR, B_SOAR, C_SOAR)**: Executes playbooks locally based on intelligence from the master SOAR.
  - **Local EDR (A_E, B_E, C_E)**: Provides endpoint data to local SIEMs and receives local SOAR actions.

### **Diagram Flow**

1. **Local Data Collection:**
   - Local Firewalls (A_F, B_F, C_F) send logs and alerts to local SIEMs (A_SIEM, B_SIEM, C_SIEM).
   - Local EDRs (A_E, B_E, C_E) provide endpoint data to local SIEMs.

2. **Local Analysis and Correlation:**
   - Local SIEMs analyze and correlate data, then stream aggregated data to the Master SIEM (M_SIEM).

3. **Central Intelligence:**
   - Master SIEM (M_SIEM) aggregates and correlates data from all local SIEMs and provides centralized intelligence to the Master SOAR (M_SOAR).

4. **Automated Response:**
   - Master SOAR (M_SOAR) updates local SOAR instances (A_SOAR, B_SOAR, C_SOAR) with new playbooks and threat intelligence.
   - Local SOAR instances execute playbooks and apply responses to local Firewalls and EDRs.

5. **Feedback Loop:**
   - Local Firewalls and EDRs send updated rules and response data back to their respective local SIEMs.
   - Local SIEMs provide feedback to the Master SIEM, which in turn updates the Master SOAR with new insights and intelligence.

This updated diagram shows how local and master instances of SIEM and SOAR work together to enhance security across all tenants, ensuring that data and responses are both locally optimized and centrally coordinated.
