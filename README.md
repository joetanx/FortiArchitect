## Web Application and API Protection (WAAP)

### Web Application Firewall

- Prevent attacks with world-class analysis of web traffic to your applications.
- Secure web applications from top security risks: OWASP top 10 protection - cover SQL injection, cross-site scripting, code injection and more.

### API Security

- Auto-discover web applications and APIs:
  - Automatically detect web-facing and API services to protect, even in ephemeral environments.
  - Automated API protection ensures your API endpoints are protected as they are published, shielding your applications from exploitation.
- API risk profiling: Identify API risk factors, sources of risk, vulnerabilities and changes to prioritize remediation or protection.
- Secure APIs against Layer 7 attacks: Simplify enforcement of positive API definitions based on OpenAPI, Swagger file or manual customization.

### Advanced Bot Protection

Prevent business logic attacks from all access points – websites, mobile apps and APIs. Gain seamless visibility and control over bot traffic to stop online fraud through account takeover or competitive price scraping.

- Allow and monitor known bots: Allow good bots such as search engine crawlers and news bots to crawl your applications, but monitor and block abusive behavior.
- Control unknown bots: Alert or block requests originating from bots with unknown intent, including headless browsers, command-line tools and good bot impersonators.
- Define custom bots: Create bot definitions for bots your team decides are known-good or malicious.

### DDoS Protection

Block attack traffic at the edge to ensure business continuity with guaranteed uptime and no performance impact. Secure your on premises or cloud-based assets – whether you’re hosted in AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Public Cloud.

### Machine Learning / Attack Analytics

- Ensures complete visibility with machine learning and domain expertise across the application security stack to reveal patterns in the noise and detect application attacks, enabling you to isolate and prevent attack campaigns.
- Automated protections and false positive remediation using human-powered AI

### Virtual patching

- Reduce risk until official patches are released: Use virtual patching to create a safeguard against exploits until the underlying service can be patched.
- Add custom WAAP rules for signatures from your team: Take advantage of custom rules, a guided, auto-complete way to secure against exploits when your research teams identify vulnerabilities.
- Protect against zero-day exploits: Automatically receive updated WAAP rules from FortiGuard and choose whether to apply them.

### Continuous visibility

- Find and protect your entire web app and API surface: Use WAAP to detect unprotected web applications and flag them for protection.
- Reduce noise by identifying only public-facing APIs: Automatically detects web app and API behavior and does not flag services without an API.
- Leverage advanced analytics for investigations: Use analytics to observe WAAP audits in aggregate from different points of view, filter them and dive into individual events for incident investigations.
- View all security events in a single console: Identify vulnerabilities, compliance violations, runtime events and WAAP events in one dashboard.

### Access Control

- Control inbound access to the application: Network controls allow administrators to deny inbound access to the application as well as allowed IPs.
- Block request based on headers: WAAS lets you block or allow requests that contain specific strings in HTTP headers.
- Protect against malicious files: Protect your applications against malware dropping by restricting uploads to just the files that match any allowed content types.

### Deployment flexibility

1. Physical/virtual WAF appliances that integrate with cloud-based security services
2. Microservices-based WAF instances that integrate with cloud-based security services
3. Cloud-based WAAP platforms with integrated WAF, Bot, API, and DDoS security controls
